- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

I use class components if im using state or you need access to lifecycle hooks.


- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Component Did Mount()  handles the rendering of your component to the UI.
ComponentDid Update() use state can be used and should component update.
componentDidCatch () Allows to catch errors and log them. 

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

they make it easy to reuse stateful logic

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

because its minimizes risk of errors when code is being pushed into production.
